  (description "The interface operator names follow from the standard RDF terms. The structure intends to be
 consistent with the spira.rb precedents, with allowance for standard Lisp idioms.
 The central terms are
 - de.setf.rdf:statement  : the combination of an de.setf.rdf:subject, de.setf.rdf:predicate, and de.setf.rdf:object
 - de.setf.rdf:subject : a resource in a statement
 - de.setf.rdf:predicate : property relating subject and object in a statement
 - de.setf.rdf:object : a resource in a statement
 See the rdf-schema[1] tr for background on the terms.

 Other resource models:
  RAP[2] : goes only as far as addProperty, lispProperties
  Jena[3] - the OWL-based model concerns just inference within and externalized from the rdf graph, but not with
   reified classes
