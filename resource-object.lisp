 Each object comprises an identifier - either a symbol or a UUID, a repository -either directly, or by
 delegation through its class, a complement of archetypal properties and a complement of prototypal properties.
 Archetypal properties are those slots for which a datatype or a predicate is declared.
 Prototypal properties are those additional values which are associated with an instance through a property
 accessor or projected on to the instance from a repository.

 In addition to the instance's owned properties, each instance is associated with a repository datatype, and
 as a default, a repository by delegation to its class.
 
 When operated on in the context of a transaction, a resource-object instance retains an history which can be used
 to effect a roll-back or to purge obsolete assersions from its repository.

 As the class is an abstract-resource-class, it is intended to be specialized rather than instantiated.
 See the resource class for the most general concrete class."))
