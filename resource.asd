  :long-description
  "`de.setf.resource` implements a transparent bidirectional projection between CLOS models and linked data
 repositories. The implementation relies on the CLOS-MOP support for augmented slot access mechanisms to
 equate class/slot structure with a resource-node[0] oriented view of RDF graphs. It includes
 interfaces to wilbur[1,2], cassandra[8], and allegro-graph[3] repositories which permits both resident and
 remote repositories.

 The core implementation involves three classes, to model classes the resource-class metaclass and the
 resource-object abstract class, and the abstract repository interface class source-mediator.
 The model classes extend the standard-class and standard-object implementations to identify concrete
 archetypal classes with resource classes in repositories, instances with individual resource by URI, and
 slots with properties and computed predicates. Extensions to the instantiation and slot access provide
 access to literal values, navigation between resource instances, and transaction support analogous to the
 JDO persistence life-cycle[4].

 The architecture and interface is analogous to other RDF data bindings, such as RDFBeans[5] and Spira[6],
 and endeavours to find a balance between structural constraints and ad-hoc comprehension well suited to
 CLOS software development.

 See README.md for more information.
